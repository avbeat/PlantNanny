An automated greenhouse aims to self-regulate conditions such as temperature, humidity, light, and CO2 levels via sensors, thermal pads, LEDs, fans and a mister located in the personal sized greenhouse. Additionally, the project will feature a website interface via wireless communication to provide the user with real time sensor readings.
